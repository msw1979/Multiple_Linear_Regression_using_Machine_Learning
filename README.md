# Multiple Linear Regression using Machine Learning
This is a PYTHON code that uses Machine Learning to perform multiple linear regression.
The data are taken from CO2 Emissions, CANADA Regression and can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/code/calvinleighton/co2-emissions-canada-regression. 
You can change the features from (i.e., Engine_Size, Cylinders, Fuel_Consumption_Comb) to other features (i.e., Fuel_Consumption_City, ...) and perform the same analysis.
The code will generate 
1) Histogram plot for every feature. 
2) Scatter plot for every feature.
3) Scatter plot for train and test data for every feature.
4) Output file that contains:
   Coefficient values
   Regression Accuracy, i.e., MAE, MSE, RMSE, RAE, RSE, and R2.
